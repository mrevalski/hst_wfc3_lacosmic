    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was created by Dr. Mitchell Revalski to clean cosmic rays from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) UVIS single-visit images (FLCs). The core algorith uses Astropy's implementation of the [ccdproc.cosmicray_lacosmic](https://ccdproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/ccdproc.cosmicray_lacosmic.html) routine, which is based on the original Laplacian Cosmic Ray Identification ([L.A.Cosmic](http://www.astro.yale.edu/dokkum/lacosmic/)) algorithm developed by  Pieter G. van Dokkum. Please see the software notes below for the appropriate references.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook includes two refinements for users to fine-tune the L.A.Cosmic settings for their data. First, the user can choose to replace negative outlier pixels with local random noise so they are not incorrectly flagged by lacosmic. Second, the user can choose to have the flux values interpolated and replaced (the default behavior of L.A.Cosmic), or to only flag these pixels in the WFC3/UVIS Data Quality (DQ) arrays. This can result in cleaner drizzles with more accurate photometry when multiple exposures are available, as these pixels are ignored by [DrizzlePac](https://www.stsci.edu/scientific-community/software/drizzlepac.html) when combining exposures with [AstroDrizzle](https://drizzlepac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/astrodrizzle.html).\n",

    "Note: To see the effects of the negative pixel replacement first run the code with fix_neg_pix = False. Open an original and cleaned FLC in DS9 and set the scale limits from from -1 to 0. Blink between the files and you should see large 'holes' in the cleaned version where very large negative values were incorrectly flagged as cosmic rays and replaced with even larger groups of negative pixels. Next, run the cleaning again with fix_neg_pix = True. Set the threshold neg_pix_sig = 1.0 for aggressive cleaning. Repeat the blink in DS9 and note that the holes are gone, but may have replaced real low-level negative noise with positive values. To determine the best neg_pix_sig value, continually increase the threshold until these negative groupings begin to re-appear. In general, testing showed that neg_pix_sig = 5.0 works well and replaces $\\sim$0.01 - 1% of all pixels. This prevents each negative outlier pixel from being replaced with a group of $\\sim$9 negative pixels, which would be $\\sim$0.1 - 10% of the data. In summary, the recommendation is to use fix_neg_pix = True, with neg_pix_sig = 5.0."
